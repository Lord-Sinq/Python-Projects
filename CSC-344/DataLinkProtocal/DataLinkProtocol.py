# Description: This program demonstrates the Data Link protocol 1-3.
# These protocols are simplex, meaning that we have data being transmitted
# one-way, although acknowledgements are sent back on the reverse channel.
# The physical layer can be configured to drop frames at a given rate, produce
# 1-bit errors at a certain rate, or do a utopian channel, were everything
# works perfectly.
#
# The packets contain ASCII characters, which are 7-bits.  The extra bit,
# The highest order bit, will be used to add even-parity to the byte. The
# receiver runs a check of the parity as well as clears that extra bit.


# The threading module is needed to do multi-threading
